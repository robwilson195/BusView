# BUS VIEW: Rob Wilson
## Notes
- The basic data models were created using an online parsing tool called quicktype, for speed of development. As such, they include several properties which are unnecessary fot the limited app functionality, which would be removed for a production application.
- For a production application, the service would be accessed through a repository, rather than directly from the view model, which would also manage polling and caching in a more abstracted way. For speed of development, this was omitted in the submission.
